* What's new in version 0.0.3a (2011-02-28)

- Manual page has been added.

* What's new in version 0.0.3 (2011-02-26)

- Resizing dynamic VDI files is finally supported!

  First expanding will (almost) always move blocks, but next ones will do it
  only if you cross 255 GB boundary, and again for ~512 GB, etc. In future it
  will be fixed, i.e. all block moving will be avoided for second and further
  resizes if block size equals multiple of 1 megabyte (I haven't seen any
  image "breaking" this rule in the wild, but it's possible).

  Even shrinking is possible, but only if does not involve discarding of
  allocated blocks. In future it will be also fixed with implementation of
  block linearization.

* What's new in version 0.0.2 (2011-02-22)

- Many restrictive assumptions about supported VDI files has been removed.
  Images created in VirtualBox 4.x should work fine now. Still only fixed
  ones can be resized.

- Before resizing user gets information about upcoming operation and question
  whether it should be really performed.

- Resizing strategy has been changed. Old one was almost always moving blocks,
  which is simply stupid and inefficient. Now if data offset can be preserved,
  i.e. there is enough space for block allocation map, block moving will be
  avoided. If it cannot be avoided, then new data offset will be aligned to
  megabyte. It nicely prevents from moving blocks in possible future resizes
  (unless you cross 255 GB boundary).

- Running in Windows 2000 is possible now.

* What's new in version 0.0.1 (2009-10-21)

- Nothing, it's just the first public version.
