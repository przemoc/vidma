* What's new

- Many restrictive assumptions about supported VDI files has been removed.
  Images created in VirtualBox 4.x should work fine now. Still only fixed
  ones can be resized.

- Before resizing user gets information about upcoming operation and question
  whether it should be really performed.

- Resizing strategy has been changed. Old one was almost always moving blocks,
  which is simply stupid and inefficient. Now if data offset can be preserved,
  i.e. there is enough space for block allocation map, block moving will be
  avoided. If it cannot be avoided, then new data offset will be aligned to
  megabyte. It nicely prevents from moving blocks in possible future resizes
  (unless you cross 255 GB boundary).

- Running in Windows 2000 is possible now.

* What's new in version 0.0.1 (2009-10-21)

- Nothing, it's just the first public version.
